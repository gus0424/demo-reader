                <p class="p p-first-last">In this paper, notions of game studies, games research, game
                  design, and design research are examined. As a most popular
                  keyword on game research papers ‘game design’ connects the
                  interdiscipline of game studies. However, it is typical that notions
                  of ‘design’ and ‘design research’ are not explicitly reflected on the
                  research papers within the academic field of game research. The
                  lack of onversation between game studies and general design
                  research is visible, yet historically explainable. However,
                  considering the maturity of the field, the presence of the theoretical
                  frameworks of design research should be improved. Understanding
                  game studies as design research potentially improves our
                  understanding on game design and alleviates the bridging of the
                  epistemic gap between the practice and academia. </p>

              <p class="p p-first">In 2008 Staffan Björk wrote how the “interest in research on gamerelated topics has
                grown strongly in recent years following the
                widespread success of computer games as cultural and commercial
                phenomena” and how “a certain level of friction has existed
                regarding what constitute proper methods and research questions”.
                Björk was searching for “an axis mundi” for game research. He
                suggested that the different research interests within the rising
                academic field were easily mapped on the three game concepts
                games, gamers and gaming. [<a href="#ref2" rid="ref2" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">2</a>]
                Also in 2008, Frans Mäyrä conceptualized how the focus of game
                studies lies in the interaction between game and player, informed
                by their various contextual frames. In his introductory book to game
                studies the intersecting views were grouped into 1) study of games,
                2) study of players, and the 3) study of the contexts of the previous
                two. [<a href="#ref26" rid="ref26" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">26</a>] The rise of the humanities and social sciences oriented game studies
                has been visible in the growth of the academic communities, such
                as DiGRA1
                and journals similar to Game Studies2
                . In 2001, Espen
                Aarseth [<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false"
                  aria-haspopup="true">1</a>] ,the Editor-in-Chief of Game Studies wrote that the year
                2001 can be seen as the “Year One of Computer Game Studies as
                an emerging, viable, international, academic field.” With a perhaps
                provocative ludological tone, Aarseth also declared how game
                studies should exist as an independent academic structure, because
                it cannot be reduced to any of the existing fields [<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1" class=" bibr popnode"
                  role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">1</a>]. Since then,
                there has been a surge of different kinds of game related studies
                from various academic perspectives and construction of multitude
                of game research conferences and other academic venues [23, 24].
                It is typical that the notions of game studies and games research or
                game research are used interchangeably. While constructing his
                “year one” declaration, Aarseth [<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1" class=" bibr popnode" role="button"
                  aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">1</a>] refers to the important and
                inevitable multitude of contributing disciplines as “we all enter this
                field from somewhere else”. He lists such fields as anthropology,
                sociology, narratology, semiotics and film studies as few relevant
                examples of academic origins of game researchers. Among other
                actors within the game academia (i.e [<a href="#ref36" rid="ref36" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">36</a>]), Mäyrä [26, 25]
                considers the multi- and interdisciplinary nature of game studies as
                richness and challenge of the community. In his reflections of
                multidisciplinary research work, Mäyrä [<a href="#ref25" rid="ref25" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">25</a>] lists combinations of
                researchers from humanities and social sciences as well as the
                combination of socio-cultural game studies with technical or
                engineering-oriented research work as examples. While the
                research projects were fruitful and the multidisciplinary approach
                has been proven to be a good “survival tactic”, he concludes that
                the role of interdisciplinarity within and around game studies is
                somewhat mixed and ambiguous. [<a href="#ref25" rid="ref25" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">25</a>].
                Many reflections on game studies are narrow and naturally affected
                by the personal academic interests of the game researchers
                themselves. Aarseth’s early manifestation on game studies
                highlighted mostly the perspective of humanistic and social
                sciences collaboration. The categories and ontologies of game
                studies by Mäyrä [<a href="#ref26" rid="ref26" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">26</a>] as well as Björk [<a href="#ref2" rid="ref2" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">2</a>] and Juul [<a href="#ref15" rid="ref15" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">15</a>] model the
                research interests of game researchers around the artefact and the
                users – leaving the other issues than the direct artefact analysis and
                user research as “context” (Mäyrä), “world” (Juul) or just the
                interplay of the two (Björk). Following these early drafts and the
                most active researchers’ disciplinary backgrounds, game studies
                has an undertone skewed towards the humanistic and social
                sciences approaches.
                With the help of general theories of interdisciplinarity, Sebastian
                Deterding [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>] has been reflecting on the interdiscipline of game
                studies. He explains how the “friction” pointed by Björk [<a href="#ref2" rid="ref2" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">2</a>] is not

                unique to game studies, and how in general the “initially
                enthusiastic interdisciplines and young interdisciplinary
                researchers” quickly encounter various challenges including the
                friction due to incompatible epistemic cultures. By dissecting the
                models of overcoming the disciplinary boundaries into multi-,
                trans- and interdisciplinarity of different levels, Deterding
                characterize game studies as narrow interdiscipline or even
                encyclopedic multidiscipline at its best. Further, he argues that the
                current development and direction of the field can be considered as
                narrowing or differentiating into multiple sub-communities – just
                like any other maturing interdiscipline [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>].
                Deterding’s observations of the multidiscipline of game studies are
                mostly anecdotal and grounded on his own experiences and
                personal discussions within the games research communities (as he
                himself points out). However, there is a rise of empirical reflections
                on the academic communities of game researchers. Mäyrä, Van
                Looy and Quandt [<a href="#ref24" rid="ref24" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">24</a>] conducted a survey on the game research
                communities of DiGRA, ECREA and ICA inquiring their
                disciplinary background, current research field, and identification
                as “digital games researcher” among other issues. They concluded
                that there is no single disciplinary field that would play a key role
                for organizing the academic identity of contemporary games
                researchers and that the research on games and play is highly
                multidisciplinary and dynamic [<a href="#ref24" rid="ref24" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">24</a>]. However, reflecting on the
                background factors of the given academic community does not give
                away the whole picture of the interdiscipline.
                Adopting an alternative approach, Mercel et al. [<a href="#ref23" rid="ref23" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">23</a>] conducted a
                data driven examination of the 15 years of game research. By
                evaluating the keywords of over 8000 game research papers, they
                identified 20 major research themes and seven distinct subcommunities. Their results support the
                commonly held assumption
                that games research has different clusters of papers and venues for
                technical versus non-technical research. Similarly to Mäyrä, Van
                Looy and Quandt, the study by Mercel et al. show the presence of
                wide variety of research interests within the different academic
                venues – however, the interpretation of the data of these two studies
                have a slightly different tone.
                As Deterding [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>] implies, it is not the background factors of the
                whole community that defines an interdiscipline. The canon of
                game studies is crafted by narrower group of academic actors and
                many of the defining handbooks and introductions are
                “unanimously written by designers and humanities scholars” [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>]. It
                could be argued that the so called “ludological approach” has
                justified such concepts as ‘game’ and ‘play’ as atoms of academic
                discussions. It is somewhat typical that a game research paper uses
                the metaphor of play or games as a model for the examined
                phenomenon, be it a phenomenon of culture, economy, social
                interactions, creativity or any other. Perhaps there is something
                exhilarating for a game researcher to be able to fortify the nonreductionist ludological stance
                initiated by Aarseth [<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">1</a>] by reducing
                other phenomena, often widely researched prior to the game
                research paper, into the vocabulary of game studies.
                Even though successful in separating the dynamics of the
                interdiscipline of game studies, Deterding [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>] lacks in the wider
                spectrum of ‘game design’. One of his suggestions to improve the
                interdiscipline, if that is the direction to take, is the scenario of
                design orientation in game studies. In his view an orientation
                towards instrumental utilization of game research through designed
                artefacts hold promise for growing and sustaining game research.
                However, in his scenario description, Deterding holds a particular
                view of design as problem-solving activity. The promise of game
                studies as an interdisciplinary effort is pictured as a contributing
                factor to the societal impact of game research and education, mainly
                in solving design problems. Conquering such path is not a trivial
                task, and the view itself is also limited.
                Perhaps Deterding’s orientation could be elaborated with such
                approaches as Jussi Kuittinen and Jussi Holopainen [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">16</a>] pursuits.
                Their academic effort is in connecting the game design studies to
                general design studies and utilizing the frameworks of such design
                theorists as Herbert A. Simon, Donald Schön, Jonas Löwgren &
                Eric Stolterman, Willemien Visser and Bryan Lawson [21, 22]. In
                their conclusion, Kuittinen & Holopainen [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">16</a>] argue that game
                design should be studied through models constructed by design
                theorists and that such approach is not present enough in the current
                game design literature.

                <p>On their examination of the academic publications of game
                  research within the period of 2000-2014, Mercel et al. [<a href="#ref23" rid="ref23" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">23</a>]
                  identified ‘game design’ as the most used keyword among the over
                  20 000 unique keywords presented in 8207 articles. While the mere
                  weight of this finding could be telling, it is hardly simple to
                  interpret. ‘Game design’ can be connected to the wide variety of
                  research papers for various different reasons. Be it a technical
                  oriented paper of an inventive algorithm or a study of a game forum
                  discussion – if the authors addressed even vaguely the potential
                  impact of the study into practice, the keyword can be found central.
                  Authors themselves do not need to be identified as game design
                  researchers.
                  Anecdotally3
                  , when asking game developers to describe their
                  conception of game design, the responses can be vastly varying on
                  the ontological level of the content. For one, ‘game design’ can
                  mean “emotion engineering” or “largely communication” whilst
                  for the other “everything that goes into a game is more or less game
                  design.”
                  On the more formal matter, many designers have gone extra mile
                  to explicate their conceptions of the game design. Due to the young
                  age of the field, it is not rare to see these design guidebooks written
                  by the industry actors cited in the academic papers. Some of the
                  books can be even considered as part of the “canon” of the game
                  studies. Katie Salen’s & Eric Zimmerman’s book Rules of Play:

                  of game design (rules, play, culture) is perhaps one of these.
                  Written for the designers, the book is widely4
                  used by the young
                  field of researchers – and often perhaps even misunderstood by the
                  research community [<a href="#ref39" rid="ref39" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">38</a>] due to the differing epistemic needs of the
                  industry and the academia (inspiration vs. foundation).
                  Conceivably one of their most cited original notion is the notion of
                  “second order design”. This is to illustrate the indirect nature of
                  designing games as computer mediated experiences: “game design
                  is a second-order design problem. A game designer designs the
                  rules of the game directly but designs the player’s experience only
                  indirectly” [<a href="#ref29" rid="ref29" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">29</a>]. However, the lack of theoretical exposure to other
                  design disciplines might lead to the overemphasis of the “special
                  nature” of a design domain close to the examiner. In a discussion
                  over Twitter in 2012 (Figure 1), Eric Zimmerman did retrospectively contemplate that “Perhaps design
                  is always about
                  second-order problems.” </p>
                <p>Another popular5
                  game design guidebook is Jesse Schell’s The Art
                  of Game Design: A Book of Lenses. Similar to Rules of Play, it
                  presents different schemata to interpret and to approach game
                  design. While Salen & Zimmerman [<a href="#ref29" rid="ref29" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">29</a>] builds their conceptions
                  around the artefact and the player’s (meaningful) experience,
                  Schell [<a href="#ref31" rid="ref31" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">31</a>] goes through different topics from game experience and
                  elements of a game, to the topics of the tools and approaches of the
                  development process all the way to the self-reflection of the
                  designer him/herself. Schell’s book is providing a seemingly honest
                  account of his personal design cognition: varying, yet not
                  exhaustive, lenses for game design. Game design accounts by
                  experienced developers such as Schell’s might seem imperfect
                  from the academic perspective as they are lacking in systematic
                  view and epistemic transparency, leading into an embrace of
                  subjectivity. Such books might end up criticized on those grounds
                  if taken into the academic contexts.
                  However, game design as a practice can be considered pluralistic,
                  pointed by Annakaisa Kultima [<a href="#ref18" rid="ref18" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">18</a>] in her study of the casual game
                  design values. In general, it is considered that design work is guided
                  by systems of designers’ values that might even contradict among
                  each other as they are not actively used in parallel [13, 21].
                  Following the changes in game design, a game designer might need
                  to adopt new design principles or shift between normative accounts
                  according to the project. Eventually design work is about seeking a
                  change as the design theorist Herbert Simon puts it: design is
                  "transformation of existing conditions into preferred ones" [<a href="#ref34" rid="ref34" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">34</a>].
                  Game design can also be considered as the pursuit of the change,
                  be it as small as a change as in an average game sequel. This creates
                  interesting epistemic stance for a designer sometimes in conflict of
                  that with a researcher [<a href="#ref20" rid="ref20" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">20</a>].
                  A design theorist Kari Kuutti [<a href="#ref20" rid="ref20" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">20</a>] has been characterizing the
                  difference between science and design by exposing the challenge
                  of academic understanding of the importance of local, particular
                  and timely knowledge. According to him [<a href="#ref20" rid="ref20" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">20</a>] “The scientific
                  apparatus simply lacks the means to deal with such knowledge, and
                  thus design has to develop means of its own.” Another design
                  theorist, Gui Bonsiepe [<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">5</a>] pictures the same challenge as designing
                  being “initially free and independent form of activity unconcerned
                  with the existence of design science”. Within the frame of game
                  studies, the accounts of game design have to face these challenges
                  of indifference. Even though appealing from an academic
                  perspective for instance cataloguing patterns in game design, such
                  as the work of Björk and Holopainen [<a href="#ref3" rid="ref3" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">3</a>] might be a strange approach to the volatile and transformative
                  field of game design.
                  From the perspective of a designer such venture might seem
                  impractical despite (and perhaps due to) the size of the epistemic
                  project.
                  Perhaps due to the absence of the academic counterparts for game
                  design theories, game studies continues to use the early conceptions
                  of the industry driven game design books. Perhaps academically
                  driven critical approaches towards the industry literature is a sort of
                  a trial in pushing the theories and the conceptions proposed by the
                  experienced designers further towards the academic account.
                  However, there is a rising body of literature on the design tools,
                  processes and methods within the game studies. This type of
                  development is not something that is unique to game research.
                  Lucienne Blessing and Amaresh Chakrabarti [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">4</a>] have been
                  suggesting that design research can be considered to have passed
                  through three overlapping phases: Experiential, Intellectual and
                  Experimentl/Empirical. In the Experiential phase senior designers
                  wrote about their experiences of the design process and the
                  resulting products, in the Intellectual phase logical and consistent
                  basis for design and many methodologies, principles and methods
                  were proposed and in the Experimental/Empirical phase empirical
                  studies were undertaken to gather data, both in the laboratory and
                  in practice, in order to understand how designers and design teams
                  actually design, and what impact the methods and tools had on the
                  process. Such narrative of the progress of design theories seem to
                  be in line with the understanding of the current field of game design
                  research – even though Blessing and Chakrabarti positioned the
                  development of the general design research already on the previous
                  century [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">4</a>], time well before the digital games.
                  Many design guidebooks have been written for and by the game
                  industry actors working on commercial game productions. The
                  supposed purpose of the books is providing conceptual tools and
                  inspiration for the practitioners. As the researchers and educators
                  also consider these as noteworthy sources of information, it is
                  appropriate to approach the design books on a critical note. Douglas
                  Wilson and Miguel Sicart [<a href="#ref38" rid="ref38" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">38</a>] point out how “game design
                  theorists have positioned game design as the craft of satisfying
                  players’ desires.” They claim to challenge the notion of “player
                  advocacy” (exemplified by Tracy Fullerton [<a href="#ref11" rid="ref11" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">11</a>]) as one-sided
                  perspective, accompanied with the language of consumerism for
                  game design. They emphasize the communication between the
                  player and the designer by coining an approach of “abusive design”.
                  In abusive game design the presence of the designer is highlighted
                  by the design moves to surprise and displease the player. According
                  to Wilson and Sicart [<a href="#ref38" rid="ref38" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">38</a>], the ideology of player advocacy has
                  resulted in an “accessibility turn” in computer games. This has
                  turned game design into the direction where “players become mere
                  customers, and designers become mere providers”. As opposed to
                  the more artistic design process, the “player advocacy” school of
                  thought is touted as conventional and monologic design. As Wilson
                  and Sicart [<a href="#ref38" rid="ref38" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">38</a>] depict the current era of game design as the era of
                  usable games with wide audiences and pleasing designs, they seek
                  more conversational relation with their critical approach to design
                  theorizing. To their conception, the most provocative game design
                  possibilities are found where the role of the designer as an advocate
                  for the player is disrupted.
                  Based on the analysis of handful of game design books from 2001-
                  2008, Kuittinen and Holopainen [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">16</a>] argue that whereas the books on game design concentrate on
                  teaching the reader the principles
                  and elements of game design, design as an activity is left for too
                  little attention. The game design books leave aspects of design
                  activity such as representing, design moves and reflecting to little
                  consideration. Design as an activity is not presented in the given
                  books as explicitly as it could be. Looking at game design through
                  general design models could open up possibilities of improving the
                  methodologies of game design. Kuittinen and Holopainen [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">16</a>] state
                  that doing game design is an activity similar to any other design
                  field but that the form and the content are specific to the game
                  design context.
                  Perhaps following the model of progress of design research
                  pictured by Blessing and Chakrabarti [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">4</a>], there is a rising body of
                  empirical research concentrating on game developers.
                  Ethnographical approaches conducted by Casey O’Donnell [<a href="#ref27" rid="ref27" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">27</a>]
                  and F. Ted Tschang [<a href="#ref35" rid="ref35" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">35</a>], or interview studies by Annakaisa
                  Kultima [<a href="#ref19" rid="ref19" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">19</a>], Mirva Peltoniemi [<a href="#ref28" rid="ref28" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">28</a>], and Ulf Hagen [<a href="#ref12" rid="ref12" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">12</a>] just to
                  name a few are important sources of descriptive accounts on the
                  practice and the contexts of game design. Instead of mere theorizing
                  on the concepts of the culture or speculating on the designers’
                  intentions or inspirations through artefact analysis [e.g. 14], studies
                  on designers, such as of Alyea Sanovar’s [<a href="#ref30" rid="ref30" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">30</a>] account on the game
                  developers’ conceptions of culture add to the body of the
                  knowledge on game design research in an important manner.
                  Despite the fact that ‘game design’ bears several meanings, there is
                  a lot of explicating to do and room for theoretical, empirical and
                  experimental work addressing different areas of game design. One
                  area of that is to keep on answering to the definitional question of
                  ‘game design’.
                  Perhaps alarming, or soothing for the game researchers, the word
                  ‘design’ is found complex on the field of design research in general.
                  As more and more design fields are emerging, it is becoming
                  increasingly difficult to address the area as unified. A design
                  historian, John A. Walker [<a href="#ref37" rid="ref37" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">37</a>] pointed out as early as in the 1980s
                  how ‘design’ has more than one common meaning: it can refer to a
                  process, the result, the products, or the look and overall pattern of
                  a product. The term has also undergone some historical changes
                  from the Renaissance ‘disegno’ meaning ‘drawing’ to the industrial
                  revolution and the introduction of the ‘designer’ all the way to the
                  value-laden ‘design’ and ‘designer’ of the 1980s [<a href="#ref37" rid="ref37" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">37</a>] continuing to
                  the current date. The scholarly meaning of the word ‘design’ has
                  been dominated by the views of industrial design and architecture.
                  By looking at the definitions of the design, Walker [<a href="#ref37" rid="ref37" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">37</a>] concluded
                  that for many scholars at that time, design was industrial design.
                  Such emphasis on material mass production might be one of the
                  reasons why digital games researchers find design research difficult
                  to utilize. There is also something unfitting and conflicting in the
                  colloquial use of ‘game designer’ within the games industry.
                  Depending on the project, social constellation of the game project
                  and the studio, a game designer might be in control of the design
                  decisions, or act as a creative mediator similar to the producer in
                  other productions. More active participation of the game design
                  research and game design researchers into the general discussion of
                  design research is more or less needed.</p>

                <p>The loose historical account of the progress of the design research
                  by Blessing and Chakrabarti [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">4</a>] is far from being elaborate enough
                  in opening the whole picture of the historical development of
                  design research. According to Nigel Cross [7], the desire to “scientise” design
                  emerged as early as in the 1920s and surfaced again in the design
                  methods movement of the 1960s. The Conference on Design
                  Methods in 1962 is generally regarded as the launch of design
                  methodology as an academic field and the 1960s has even been
                  heralded as the “design science decade” fashioned by the
                  positivistic attitude on the potential of the combination of design
                  and science. Cross [7] further discusses how terms such as ‘design
                  science’ and ‘science of design’ bear a different meaning: former
                  refers to a search for a single method for science-like design and
                  the latter to the study of designing as academic endeavor. The
                  modern term of ‘design research’ is to Cross [7] a goal of
                  “development, articulation and communication of design
                  knowledge”. Furthermore the sources of such knowledge to him are
                  to be found in people, processes and products. Following, his
                  taxonomy for the field of design research falls into three main
                  categories: design epistemology (study of designerly ways of
                  knowing), design praxiology (study of the practices and processes
                  of design) and design phenomenology (study of the form and
                  configuration of artifacts). To Cross [7] the challenge for design
                  research is to be at the same time interdisciplinary and disciplined
                  – a “paradoxical task of creating an interdisciplinary discipline.”
                  [7]
                  The different taxonomies of design research are also utilized, if not
                  too thoroughly, by the game researchers. Perhaps one of the most
                  famous and often used typology is that of Christopher Frayling’s
                  [<a href="#ref10" rid="ref10" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">10</a>]. Frayling, adapting Herbert Read’s distinction about art
                  education, divides research into three different categories: research
                  for, into and through (art and) design. Of these the last is sometimes
                  used as positioning more experimental, practice oriented or
                  engaging game design research projects on the field of game studies
                  whereas other endeavors might not need such positioning. The
                  framing of design research is called upon on the “difficult” or
                  academically more unconventional cases.
                  In a similar way to Frayling, Keiichi Sato [<a href="#ref32" rid="ref32" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">32</a>] differentiates two
                  ways of using the word design research. According to Sato, design
                  research can have at least two distinctive meanings. On one hand it
                  might denote the practice of developing information for a particular
                  design project and on the other hand it indicates the practice of
                  developing a generalized and structured body of knowledge
                  (academic research). Furthermore Sato’s typology for design
                  research divides the academic design research into theoretical
                  research, methodological research, experimental research, field
                  research and case studies [<a href="#ref32" rid="ref32" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">32</a>]. In game design research, it seems,
                  that such borders are not necessary that clear between the industry
                  and the academia (or project and the more general approaches). As
                  already mentioned previously, the title of the game design theorists
                  can be given to a representative of either side of the fence (industry
                  or academia). Furthermore, it seems that many humanistic or social
                  science oriented game studies could be framed design research on
                  the Sato’s account.
                  Perhaps more pressingly, Gui Bonsiepe [<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">5</a>] distinguishes
                  endogenous and exogenous design research. Endogenous design
                  research is initiated spontaneously from within the field of design
                  whereas the exogenous design research is interested in the design
                  as an object of scientific inquiry. For Bonsiepe, endogenous design
                  research is primarily instrumental and tied to design projects and
                  embedded into the design processes similar to Sato [<a href="#ref32" rid="ref32" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">32</a>]. However,
                  Bonsiepe hopes for the endogenous design research to eventually
                  reach for more general level of knowledge similar to exogenous
                  design research. For Bonsiepe the danger of exogenous research,
                  then again, is to fall into the normative account of design
                  disconnected from practice [<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">5</a>]. In game design research, the academic values of “critical” approach
                  might push early
                  researchers into the narrative of the industry driven design
                  theorists’ of “best practices” before there is adequate descriptive
                  understanding on the field.
                  Perhaps depending on the epistemological or philosophical
                  presuppositions and the disciplinary backgrounds of a researcher,
                  design research can seem as an ill-fitted and hopelessly unorganized academic field. Blessing and
                  Chakrabarti [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">4</a>], coming
                  from the engineering background, identified the common
                  challenges of the design research as 1) lack of overview of existing
                  research, 2) lack of use of results in practice, and 3) lack of
                  scientific rigor [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">4</a>]. It could be argued that the issues pointed by
                  Blessing and Chakrabarti [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">4</a>] can be connected to the challenges of
                  many interdisciplinary efforts. The challenge of the
                  interdisciplinary discipline pinned by Cross [7] is a familiar one to
                  any of the contemporary game researchers and the lack of shared
                  understandings of the general design theories instead of that
                  provided by the design guidebooks is perhaps further contributing
                  to the slow progress of the game design research.
                  As pointed by Kuittinen and Holopainen [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">16</a>], utilizing the general
                  theories within the design research provides possibilities for the
                  game design research to grow. Such one-sidedness as the problemdriven design orientation of game
                  studies proposed by Deterding
                  [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>] can be an example of lack of awareness in underlying paradigms
                  in design warned by Cross [7], if not intentionally selected
                  perspective. Cross points the different underpinnings of design
                  theories of Herbert Simon and Donald Schön, which has been more
                  thoroughly studied by Dorst and Dijkhuis [<a href="#ref9" rid="ref9" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">9</a>]. According to Dorst
                  and Dijkhuis, Simon’s [<a href="#ref34" rid="ref34" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">34</a>] theories lead to a conceptualizing
                  design as “rational problem solving” whereas Schön’s [<a href="#ref33" rid="ref33" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">33</a>] theories
                  emphasize design as “reflective practice”. This differentiation has
                  been utilized by Kultima [<a href="#ref17" rid="ref17" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">17</a>] in proposing underlying schools of
                  thoughts also within the practice of game design as a hobby,
                  profession and educated practice.
                  In their examination of the shortcomings of design research
                  Blessing and Chakrabarti [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">4</a>] are not completely clear whether the
                  issues they have raised are fatal to the purely academic endeavors
                  or the practice itself. Similarly to Aarseth, Cross [7] warns us on
                  [<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">1</a>] “swamping the design research with different cultures imported
                  from either the sciences or the arts”. Even though there is a need to
                  utilize different disciplinary traditions, Cross wants us to realize
                  how the design practice has its own strong and appropriate
                  intellectual culture. This culture could be an interest for the wider
                  understanding of the cognitive theories. Somewhat provocatively,
                  he claims epistemology of science being in “disarray, and therefore
                  has little to offer to an epistemology of design.” This claim is
                  supported by Bryan Lawson [<a href="#ref21" rid="ref21" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">21</a>], as to him the study of what
                  designers know “challenges our more conventional understanding
                  of what makes good knowledge in ways that might be of interest
                  and value to those in the information and cognitive sciences.” Such
                  understanding of the nature of design research should be also
                  visible in the various design-oriented studies within the field of
                  game research instead of taken granted the epistemologies of more
                  traditional disciplines.
                  Similar to this, as pointed by Deterding [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>], in order for game
                  studies to overcome its narrow epistemic nature, it is to find its
                  ways to allow and work with epistemological pluralism similar to
                  cases in cognitive sciences or communication research. Eventually
                  any interdisciplinary efforts are bound to be challenged by varying epistemic cultures taking us
                  researchers outside our comfort zones
                  of the disciplinary backgrounds. </p>

              <div class="sec">
                <p>Following Bonsiepe’s distinction of endogenous and exogenous
                  design research, the examination of these two epistemic cultures is
                  relevant also within game research. Game research is conducted
                  both within the interdisciplinary communities as well as growingly
                  among established disciplines of academia elsewhere. Another
                  relevant epistemic community is that of game professionals,
                  outside of the game academia. Many game design projects seek
                  new knowledge in order to pursue with new technologies, improve
                  the performance of the existing technologies, understanding new
                  and existing user groups, and to tweak their design in many
                  opportunistic ways. Before concluding this paper, it is only suitable
                  to devote couple of sentences to the epistemic undertakings of the
                  industry and how to potentially bridge the gap between the
                  academia and the industry.
                  Mäyrä, Van Looy and Quandt [<a href="#ref24" rid="ref24" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">24</a>] examined the nature of the game
                  researchers’ collaboration as one of the defining background
                  factors. As high as 39 % of the respondents (n=544) reported
                  having some sort of research collaboration with the industry. The
                  nature of the collaboration was not explicated, but one of the
                  explaining factors could be found in the funding instruments of
                  research. Many game scholars struggle as outside actors of the
                  established disciplines and it is typical to seek aggressively for
                  external funding. Some instances, such as EU research funding
                  favor projects with appropriate industry partners to improve the
                  possibilities of the societal impact of the conducted research [<a href="#ref24" rid="ref24" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">24</a>].
                  It is also probable that some of the respondents have been working
                  on the internal research projects of the game companies or projects
                  externally funded by industry actors.
                  Which ever explains the relatively high percentage of industry
                  collaboration, the epistemic premises of these two create
                  phenomenon worth to investigate. As already mentioned, Kuutti
                  [<a href="#ref20" rid="ref20" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">20</a>] and Bonsiepe [<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">5</a>] highlight the special nature of design
                  cognition. Furthermore, Bonsiepe [<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">5</a>] discusses that there is a
                  special kind of interplay between research and practice. To him,
                  “designers can no longer design the way they did one or two
                  generations ago” and “researchers can no longer do research as they
                  did one of two generations ago – i.e. orienting themselves primarily
                  or exclusively by texts.” Bonsiepe [<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">5</a>] is talking about iconic turn
                  in research whereas the rising complexity in design processes calls
                  for more systematic approaches. Seeking synergy between game
                  creators and game researchers is a natural continuation of such
                  blurring of the lines.
                  Similar to the utilization of game design guidebooks as academic
                  references, it is not atypical for a game researcher interested in
                  game design to participate to the game industry conferences and
                  events instead of or in addition to the academic conferences. In the
                  US, such conferences as the Game Developers Conference6
                  held
                  annually at San Francisco can be relevant to the game design
                  researchers for various reasons. The areas of interest are shared
                  with the developers, even though the social processes of
                  conducting, recording and evaluating research might differ
                  drastically. Additionally to this, there is a lack of good sources of
                  information on the emerging design areas and the topics change and
                  transform fast making it difficult for an academic to follow. Industry conferences are also excellent
                  places for deeper
                  discussions with the industry practitioners. Other notable
                  conferences are the Casual Connect in Europe and US, and the
                  annual Nordic Game Conference7
                  in Sweden, bringing together the
                  Northern European game developers, students and educators.
                  Similar venues are spread around the calendar year and around the
                  globe to the extent that a diligent traveler easily spots the same
                  presentations in different conferences during the year.
                  However, many researchers (as well as developers) have no
                  possibilities to travel to the industry conferences due to the limited
                  travel budgets and schedules. Fortunately for the stationary
                  academic researcher, game industry in its boom is relatively open
                  to share the presentations of the industry conferences also after or
                  during the events. Even though many of these are available for
                  anyone to watch, there is also business around the information
                  sharing. Example of this is the GDC Vault8
                  . UBM Tech, as the
                  owner of the GDC conference brand also maintains an online
                  magazine Gamasutra.com9
                  which collects professionals’ views on
                  their products and processes and aggregates hundreds of developer
                  blogs. Such library of developers’ views on their art is valuable also
                  for the future game research. Popular data set drawn from the
                  Gamasutra.com (and Game Developers Magazine) is that of “game
                  design postmortems” where the developers dissect their
                  development process publicly into “What went wrong?” and “What
                  went right?” If a game educator might want to ban Wikipedia as a
                  source of information in student essays (making it sometimes very
                  difficult to for instance cite to game related information), the
                  industry speeches and presentations around the web provide even
                  faster paths for the current state of the art for the outsiders, as well
                  as to the insiders of the industry. The epistemic usefulness and
                  reliability is just a matter of literacy skills for the both parties. This
                  was highlighted for instance by Rami Ismail, a successful indie
                  game developer, in his keynote for Pocket Gamer Connects
                  Helsinki conference in 2015: the game industry is moving fast and
                  the speeches by the industry actors hold a truth for a particular game
                  project on a particular platform and in a particular slice of time. He
                  encouraged his peers to go to the talks, but to form their own
                  opinion by putting together the pieces of information as trends
                  instead of treating the lessons straightforwardly.
                  Another type of information source provided by the game industry
                  is the industry reports on the salaries of the developers, the growth
                  of the industry, the players of certain games and mixed topics white
                  papers. For instance in Finland, an annual report of the state of the
                  national games industry is provided by non-profit and nonacademic game industry organization,
                  Neogames10. Such reports
                  have been criticized in academic use, since similar to the
                  Gamasutra.com design post mortems, the publication value differ
                  to those of the values of academia.
                  What is typical of such accounts is that the expert knowledge is
                  shared almost “by the hour” and many of such is fast outdated and
                  far from “re-searched”. On the other hand, following the academic
                  values of conducting research, many of the topics could take too
                  long to survey. Despite their reliability, some of the presentations
                  and publications hold invaluable role as recordings of the future
                  history of game development. This echoes well with the notion of
                  the “artifact knowledge” by Kuutti [<a href="#ref20" rid="ref20" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">20</a>]. Where the purpose of
                  science is to produce general, global, and timeless knowledge, the artifact knowledge is always
                  particular and timely according to
                  Kuutti.
                  If there is enough already to juggle with the varying epistemic
                  cultures between the academic disciplines, game research as design
                  research, seem to have another interesting epistemic challenge to
                  consider: that of design knowledge.</p>

              <div class="sec">
                <p>In some level, approaching game design as design research could
                  revolutionize the way that we see game studies. The ‘design’,
                  ‘designer’, ‘process’ and ‘practice’ have been previously part of the
                  box of “context” [<a href="#ref26" rid="ref26" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">26</a>] or otherwise in the periphery whereas ‘game’,
                  ‘player’ and ‘playing’ have being the dominate conceptual tools
                  [26, 2]. Following the taxonomies, conceptualizations and
                  categorizations of design generalists, we could end up in different
                  emphasis on the theorizing over games. Even though such a “design
                  turn” in game studies might not be as overarching as the
                  “ludological turn” was, it certainly could be eye-opening and
                  contribute to the maturing of the field itself.
                  For instance utilizing the taxonomy of Cross [7] would create a very
                  different version of game studies pulling design cognition and the
                  practice to the front row of the attention instead of the somewhat
                  dominant presence of the humanistic and social sciences driven
                  “canon” [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>]. Such positioning would at least add to the body of the
                  basic literature within the game studies.
                  With a more careful elaboration, the design orientation of game
                  studies proposed by Deterding [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">8</a>] could lead to fruitful
                  collaborations between the researchers interested in game design.
                  Being able to resort on a more general level of design conceptions
                  could act as a way of bringing in the different, perhaps
                  underrepresented areas of game studies with sustainability. And to
                  further push the multitude of epistemologies, such endeavors would
                  not only need tools in understanding the dynamics of
                  interdiscipline, but also the dynamics of multiprofessional
                  environments. Design brings together multitude of perspectives,
                  naturally.
                  On a more moderate account similar to Kuittinen and Holopainen
                  [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">16</a>], the utilization of design conceptualizations can potentially
                  shed light to the topics of design philosophies behind different
                  issues of the design practice [e.g. 17]. Such explorations could be
                  done within other disciplines (in this case within the communities
                  of design research around the Design Issues or Design Studies, for
                  example) or within the interdiscipline of game studies. It is
                  recommendable that researchers interested in the different layers of
                  game design would draw from and engage in the more general
                  discussions of design theories. This would potentially help us
                  deepen the issues already scratched in the individual studies and to
                  bring relevant research closer to each other in a manner that mere
                  concepts of ‘play’ and ‘games’ cannot yield. Simultaneously the
                  collaborations between the industry and the academia should be
                  continued with the help of the added understanding of the
                  epistemological differences and similarities within the research
                  interests of academia and practice.
                  Overlooking the history of already over 30 years of game research
                  published in the Simulation & Gaming [6], Espen Aarseth wrote in
                  2001 that “we have a billion dollar industry with almost no basic
                  research.” Despite whether 2001 was a true “Year One” or “The Year 31” and what is considered as
                  “basic research” for game
                  studies or game research, or games research, in 2015 we still have
                  a lot to do.

              <div class="sec">
                <p>In this paper, the notion of game design research has been
                  discussed. In result of the examination, the emphasis of the design
                  research as a theoretical background for future research within the
                  community of game studies is encouraged. If such effort would not
                  lead to the revolutionizing the “interdisciplinary discipline” of
                  games research, it would add depth to the many issues of game
                  design already widely explored and perhaps help bring the relevant
                  topics closer together on a such fast developed field of
                  interdiscipline as game studies.
